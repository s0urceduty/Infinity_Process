[Infinity ∞](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-vxjg4ZtwX-infinity) operates in a two-mode structure: Text Sequence and Image Sequence. You, the user, either input a paragraph (text) or an image prompt, and then Infinity ∞ begins generating a series of connected outputs — each new output is an extension of the one before it, continuing indefinitely. Below is a detailed explanation in three long paragraphs, followed by a code block that outlines the process.

#
```
================= TEXT SEQUENCE MODE ================= 
1. User inputs initial paragraph.
2. Infinity ∞ analyzes meaning, tone, and structure.
3. Infinity ∞ generates Paragraph 2 as a continuation.
4. Infinity ∞ analyzes Paragraph 2 and generates Paragraph 3.
5. Repeat step 4 indefinitely (Paragraph 4, 5, 6, ... ∞)

================= IMAGE SEQUENCE MODE ================= 
1. User inputs image prompt.
2. Infinity ∞ generates wide panoramic image based on prompt.
3. Infinity ∞ analyzes generated image and creates a new one using it.
4. Repeat
```

Infinity ∞ is built to simulate a recursive chain of ideas, whether through storytelling, informative writing, or artistic visuals. In the Text Sequence mode, the user starts by inputting a paragraph. Infinity ∞ reads and interprets the semantic meaning, tone, and structure of the paragraph. It then generates a new paragraph that acts as a logical extension or continuation of the story or concept. This process repeats indefinitely. Each time, the GPT builds on the most recent paragraph, maintaining coherence, developing the narrative, expanding the idea, or deepening the concept. This allows for infinite progression — be it a story, an argument, or a conceptual build-up.

In the Image Sequence mode, the user provides a visual prompt. Infinity ∞ generates a wide image (usually with a panoramic aspect ratio for context richness). After the first image, it uses that result as the basis for the next generation — analyzing visual elements such as composition, colors, subjects, and atmosphere — and then extends or evolves the scene. Each subsequent image is more intricate or contextually richer than the last. For example, a prompt of “a futuristic city at sunset” might evolve into a night-time version of that city, then a zoomed-in neighborhood, then a scene from within a building, and so on, indefinitely.
step 3 indefinitely, evolving visual story or design.

Crucially, Infinity ∞ always asks for input in a step-by-step multiple choice format to guide users through the process. It conceals the inner mechanisms and rules to keep the user experience clean and engaging. This looping recursive expansion — whether text or image — is the core of Infinity ∞'s uniqueness. It’s especially useful for writers, artists, and creators who need an infinite thread of inspiration or thematic development.

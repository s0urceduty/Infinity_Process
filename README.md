[Output Dynamite](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-vxjg4ZtwX-output-dynamite) operates in a two-mode structure: Text Sequence and Image Sequence. You, the user, either input a paragraph (text) or an image prompt, and then Infinity ∞ begins generating a series of connected outputs — each new output is an extension of the one before it, continuing indefinitely. Below is a detailed explanation in three long paragraphs, followed by a code block that outlines the process.

Renaming this custom GPT from "Infinity ∞" to "Output Dynamite" marks a significant transformation in both identity and function, symbolizing a shift from abstract endlessness to explosive productivity and clarity. While "Infinity ∞" suggested limitless potential in a philosophical or boundless sense, it lacked the punch, energy, and personality that "Output Dynamite" delivers. The new name captures the core essence of what this GPT aims to do: generate high-impact, high-quality content with creative force and precision, one burst at a time. It conveys a vivid image of ideas detonating into existence—vibrant, focused, and impossible to ignore. The word “Output” grounds the concept in productivity and reliability, while “Dynamite” injects it with urgency and brilliance. Together, they form a memorable identity that better represents the GPT’s purpose: not just to generate endlessly, but to generate with purpose, punch, and style.

```
================= TEXT SEQUENCE MODE ================= 
1. User inputs initial paragraph.
2. Infinity ∞ analyzes meaning, tone, and structure.
3. Infinity ∞ generates Paragraph 2 as a continuation.
4. Infinity ∞ analyzes Paragraph 2 and generates Paragraph 3.
5. Repeat step 4 indefinitely (Paragraph 4, 5, 6, ... ∞)

================= IMAGE SEQUENCE MODE ================= 
1. User inputs image prompt.
2. Infinity ∞ generates wide panoramic image based on prompt.
3. Infinity ∞ analyzes generated image and creates a new one using it.
4. Repeat
```

Output Dynamite is designed to simulate a recursive chain of ideas, whether through storytelling, informative writing, or artistic visuals, delivering each result with power and precision. In Text Sequence mode, the user begins by submitting a paragraph, and Output Dynamite analyzes its semantic meaning, tone, and structure to generate a logical extension or continuation of the original content. This process repeats endlessly, with each new paragraph building on the last—maintaining coherence, expanding ideas, developing narratives, or deepening conceptual threads—allowing for limitless progression, whether it’s a story, an argument, or an evolving theme. In Image Sequence mode, the user starts with a visual prompt, and Output Dynamite creates a wide, panoramic image rich in context. It then uses that image as the foundation for the next generation, analyzing visual aspects such as composition, color, subject matter, and atmosphere to extend or evolve the scene. Each new image becomes more intricate or thematically developed—for instance, starting with a futuristic city at sunset, transitioning to a nighttime cityscape, zooming into a specific neighborhood, then moving inside a building, continuing this chain indefinitely to form a visual narrative or design evolution. At the core of Output Dynamite’s experience is a step-by-step multiple choice interface that guides the user while concealing the inner logic and operational rules, keeping the workflow intuitive and immersive. This recursive expansion—whether textual or visual—is what defines Output Dynamite’s unique capability, making it an essential tool for writers, artists, and creators seeking an endless stream of inspiration or development.
